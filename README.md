# FileReOrg

_In the modern connected internet era, almost everyone downloads/creates at least a few files daily and we tend to save at the same place for the convenience of access. But, with time the number of files keep on growing and tend to seem like mess and takes a lot of space. In This project I am trying to solve this problem by writing a tool. The Tool will tackle the mess by classifying all the files in the given folder according to file type. File type identification will be done using raw data/metadata instead of file extension because most of the downloaded files does not comes with file extension. And to tackle space issues, Files Compression and decompression will be used. In this tool I am using Lempel-Ziv Data Compression Algorithm (LZ777) / Huffman lossless data compression algorithm in java language._
